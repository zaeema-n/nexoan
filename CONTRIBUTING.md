## Making Changes

### Branching Strategy

Create a topic branch from the main branch for your changes:

```

### Commit Messages

Write clear and meaningful commit messages. We recommend following this format:

```

Longer description if needed. Explain the "why" behind the change,
not just the "what". Reference any related issues.

```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### Coding Standards

- Add unit tests directly inside the `tests/` directory and organize test files in a clear, maintainable structure.
- Ensure all test cases are correct, validated, and cover the intended functionality thoroughly.
- Run all tests locally to confirm they pass before committing, and update or add tests as needed for any new changes.

### Testing

All changes should include appropriate tests. Run the test suite before submitting:

```bash
pytest
```
