Open General Information Network here after referred to as **OpenGIN** is an open-source platform designed to build a time-aware digital twin of an eco-system by defining its entities, relationships and data according to a specification. OpenGIN core supports a vide variety of data formats to provide efficient querying to simulate the digital twin. Underneath OpenGIN uses a polyglot database definition which supports to represent the changes of an eco-system through time-travelling. 

**See OpenGIN in action**: [OpenGINXplore](https://github.com/LDFLK/openginxplore) is a reference app built using OpenGIN, that can explore Sri Lankan government data.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Temporal, Entity-Centric Model      | Models all data as Entities with time-aware values, preserving historical context and enabling timeline-based analysis. |
| Intent-Aware Data Ingestion         | Captures semantic intent, metadata, and temporal information at ingestion time to improve discovery and retrieval.      |
| Polyglot Storage Abstraction        | Seamlessly supports graph, document, and tabular storage while abstracting underlying storage complexity.               |
| Advanced Discovery & Querying       | Enables complex, cross-dataset queries that respect relationships, hierarchies, and time.                               |
| Ecosystem & Organizational Modeling | Supports modeling governments, organizations, businesses, and ecosystems as interconnected, evolving systems.           |
| Historical & Structural Analysis    | Allows users to explore how entities and relationships change over time within and across systems.                      |
| Graph Capabilities | Powerful relationship traversal and querying. |
| Scalability | Microservices architecture allows independent scaling of components. |
| Strict Contracts | Uses Protobuf for internal communication and OpenAPI for external REST APIs. |
